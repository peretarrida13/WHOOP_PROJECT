1. Respiratory Infections (e.g., Pneumonia, Bronchitis):
    - Respiratory Rate: Increased respiratory rate can indicate respiratory distress.
    - SpO2 Percentage: Decreased blood oxygen levels can signal impaired lung function.
        
2. Cardiovascular Diseases (e.g., Heart Disease, Hypertension):
    - Resting Heart Rate: Elevated resting heart rate can be a sign of cardiovascular stress.
    - HRV (Heart Rate Variability): Abnormal HRV, particularly reduced variability, may indicate cardiovascular issues.

3. Sleep Disorders (e.g., Sleep Apnea, Insomnia):
    - Total Awake Time, Total Light Sleep Time, Disturbance Count: Increased values can suggest sleep disorders.
    - Sleep Efficiency Percentage: Low sleep efficiency can be a sign of disturbed sleep.

4. Febrile Illnesses (e.g., Influenza, COVID-19):
    - Skin Temperature: Elevated body temperature is a common symptom of febrile illnesses.
    - Resting Heart Rate: Increased rate may occur during fever.
    - HRV: Changes in HRV can accompany illness.

5. Anxiety or Stress-Related Disorders:
    - HRV: Lower HRV can indicate stress or anxiety.
    - Resting Heart Rate: Elevated resting heart rate can also be a sign of stress or anxiety.
    - Sleep Data (Total Awake Time, Light Sleep, Disturbance Count, Sleep Efficiency): Disturbed sleep patterns can be associated with stress or anxiety.

6. Diabetes: (Indirect correlations)
    - Sleep Data (Total Awake Time, Light Sleep, Disturbance Count, Sleep Efficiency): Disrupted sleep patterns can sometimes occur with diabetes.
    - HRV: Changes in HRV can be indirectly related to diabetes.

7. Dehydration or Heat-Related Illnesses:
    - Skin Temperature: Elevated temperature can indicate heat-related stress.
    - Resting Heart Rate: Increased heart rate might occur with dehydration or heat-related illnesses.

8. Anemia:
    - SpO2 Percentage: Decreased oxygen saturation levels can be a sign of anemia.
    - Resting Heart Rate: An increased heart rate can occur as the body attempts to compensate for reduced oxygen carrying capacity.
